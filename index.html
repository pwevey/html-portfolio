      I am the Manager of the Technical Services department at BobCAD-CAM.
      BobCAD-CAM is a CAD-CAM software that was created in 1985. The software
      supports Milling machines (2.5 up to 5 axis), Lathes, Mill-Turn, Wire EDM,
      Laser, Plasma and Waterjet. CAD-CAM software is used in the manufacturing
      industry to create programs that post out G and M codes to get sent and
      run on those machines. This process is called, "CNC" or Computer Numeric
      Control and is used for precision machining where the tolerance of the
      parts that get produced can be anywhere from +/- 0.005" (in industry
      terms: plus or minus 5 "thou") for Milling machines and +/- 0.0001" (One
      tenth of a "thou") for Wire EDM machines. To put into perspective, the
      thickness of a human hair is around 0.002" or 2 "thou".
